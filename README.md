** Explanation:

- Volume Calculation: The volume of the package is calculated by multiplying the width, height, and length (in cm³).
- Bulky Package Check: The package is considered bulky if:
  * Its volume is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 cm³, or
  * Any of its dimensions (width, height, or length) are greater than or equal to 150 cm.
- Heavy Package Check: The package is considered heavy if its mass is greater than or equal to 20 kg.
- Sorting Logic:
  * REJECTED: If the package is both bulky and heavy, it is rejected.
  * SPECIAL: If the package is either bulky or heavy, it goes to the special stack.
  * STANDARD: If the package is neither bulky nor heavy, it goes to the standard stack.

** Test Cases:

- (100, 100, 100, 25): The mass is 25 kg (heavy), so it will go to the "SPECIAL" stack.
- (200, 200, 200, 5): The volume is massive and exceeds 1,000,000 cm³, and the mass is 5 kg, so this package will be rejected because it is both bulky and heavy.
- (50, 50, 50, 10): This package is neither bulky nor heavy, so it goes to the "STANDARD" stack.
- (150, 150, 150, 5): This package is bulky because its dimensions exceed 150 cm, so it goes to the "SPECIAL" stack.
- (100, 100, 100, 10): This package is neither bulky nor heavy, so it goes to the "STANDARD" stack.

** Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this function is O(1), as it only involves a few arithmetic operations and condition checks, regardless of the input size.
